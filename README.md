# Calculator-TOO.0
First repository

Calculator TOO.0

will perform basic arithmetic of two floats (or more if answers are operated on). A history of answers will dynamically appear, and the user will have the option to scroll through it. More mathematical functionality will be added in future updates.

FUTURE UPDATES AT A GLANCE:
  a) Menu
  b) Scrolling history
  c) More mathematical functions, potentially solve-for-a-variable
