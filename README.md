# Calculator-TOO.0
First repository

Calculator TOO.0

will perform basic arithmetic of two floats (or more if answers are operated on). A history of answers will dynamically appear, and the user will have the option to scroll through it and copy-and-paste an answer. More mathematical functionality will be added in future updates.

FUTURE UPDATES AT A GLANCE:
  a) Scrolling history
  b) More mathematical functions, potentially solve-for-x

The "TOO" in its name alludes to its talkative nature.
